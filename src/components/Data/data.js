        title: "Blue whales switch when they sing for migration",
        body: `The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth.It’s also among the loudest.Sound is a vital mode of communication in the ocean environment, especially over long distances, ” says William Oestreich, a graduate student in biology at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station.Light, or any sort of visual cue, is often not as effective in the ocean as it is on land.So many marine organisms use sound for a variety of purposes, including communicating and targeting food through echolocation.”Although scientists have studied whale songs for decades, they have had limited success in deciphering their meaning.

                Now, through recording both individual whales and their greater populations in the Northeast Pacific, researchers have identified patterns in the trills and bellows of blue whales that indicate when the animals are migrating from their feeding grounds off the North American coast to their breeding grounds off Central America.

                Their research appears in Current Biology.

                “We decided to compare daytime and nighttime song patterns from month to month, and there, in the divergence and convergence of two lines, was this beautiful signal that neither of us really expected,” says John Ryan, a biological oceanographer at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and senior author of the paper. “As soon as that image popped up on the screen, Will and I were both like, ‘Hello, behavior.'”
                Blue whales sing solo and in chorus

                Further analysis across the five years of hydrophone recordings could reveal new information about blue whale migration, a 4,
                        000-mile journey that ranks among the longest in the world—which the creatures repeat every year.

                Despite the immensity of blue whales and their travels, scientists know very little about their behaviors, such as how they are responding to changes in the ecosystem and food supply from year to year. Being able to predict the travel of whales along this important route could also help prevent ship strikes.

                To capture whales singing solo and in chorus, researchers used two advanced recording technologies: an underwater microphone—called a hydrophone—and tags that the researchers placed on individual whales.

                In 2015, MBARI deposited a hydrophone 18 miles off the Monterey coast,
                        3,
                        000 feet (900 meters) under sea level. The hydrophone is wired to their MARS undersea cabled observatory, which provides it with power and communications. This seafloor eavesdropper has recorded the deep ocean soundscape almost continuously for more than five years.

                “The hydrophone fits in your hand,” says Ryan, who recommends listening to the hydrophone livestream in fall for optimal whale music (although only the humpback whale song can be heard through ordinary speakers). “It’s a little instrument that produces big data—about two terabytes per month.”

                By focusing on the whale song wavelengths in the hydrophone data, the researchers noticed a distinct change over several months. Through the summers, the whale arias grew louder and were sung mostly at nighttime.
                Whale behavior

                Over the five years of data, the whale chorus was loudest around October and November, and singing happened more at nighttime. Following each annual peak in song activity, as the whales began to depart for warmer waters, singing became more of a daytime activity.

                While previous research has noted daytime versus nighttime differences in singing behavior, the whale-borne tags, developed in the lab of Stanford biologist Jeremy Goldbogen, helped explain what these 24-hour patterns and their inversion in late autumn could mean.

                Fifteen tags tracked the sounds of their carriers through accelerometer measurements—which monitor vibrations—and, in some cases, integrated hydrophones.

                In the summer, the whales spent much of the daytime feasting, bulking up for the long journey ahead, and reserved their musical interludes for nighttime. When the time came, migration was again accompanied by daytime songs.

                “In the hydrophone data, we saw really strong patterns over this enormous spatial domain. When we saw the exact same pattern on individual animals, we realized that what we’d been measuring over hundreds of kilometers is actually a real behavioral signal—and one that represents the behavior of many different whales,” says Oestreich. “As an ecologist, it’s very exciting to observe so many whales, simultaneously, using one instrument.”
                Air traffic control for the ocean

                This research lays the groundwork for possibly predicting blue whale migration based on the transitions between the different song schedules. Such forecasts could be used to warn shipping lanes further down the coast, like air traffic control, but for the ocean.

                The researchers also hope that further analysis of the acoustic data will reveal more about whale behavior in response to environmental changes, such as warming waters and fickle food supplies.

                “If, for example, we can detect differences in migration and foraging in response to changes in the environment, that is a really powerful and important way to keep an eye on this critically endangered species,” says Goldbogen, an assistant professor of biology and also senior author of the paper. “That’s economically important, ecologically important, and also culturally important.”

                Already, Oestreich is pursuing a related question: If we can use this signal to determine whether whales are foraging or migrating, are whales using it that way too? It’s possible, says Oestreich, that a lone whale might listen around before giving up on feeding and heading south.

                “Blue whales exist at incredibly low densities with enormous distances between them but, clearly, are sharing information in some way,” says Oestreich. “Trying to understand that information sharing is one motivation, but also potentially using that signaling as a means to study them is another exciting possibility.”

        "body": `
            In some cooling magmas, crystals can grow up to a yard in just one day, according to a new study.

            Aquamarine, emerald, garnet, zircon, and topaz are but a few of the crystalline minerals found mostly in pegmatites, veinlike formations that commonly contain both large crystals and hard-to-find elements like tantalum and niobium.

            Another common find is lithium, a vital component of electric car batteries.

            “This is one step towards understanding how Earth concentrates lithium in certain places and minerals,” says Patrick Phelps, a graduate student at Rice University and coauthor of the paper in Nature Communications. “If we can understand the basics of pegmatite growth rates, it’s one step in the direction of understanding the whole picture of how and where they form.”

            Pegmatites form when rising magma cools inside Earth. They feature some of Earth’s largest crystals. South Dakota’s Etta mine, for example, features log-sized crystals of lithium-rich spodumene, including one 42 feet in length in weighing an estimated 37 tons.

            The research attempts to answer a question that has long vexed mineralogists: How can such large crystals be in pegmatites?

            “In magmatic minerals, crystal size is traditionally linked to cooling time,” says Cin-Ty Lee, professor of geology and chair of the earth, environmental, and planetary sciences department at Rice. “The idea is that large crystals take time to grow.”

            Magma that cools rapidly, like rock in erupted lavas, contains microscopic crystals, for example. But the same magma, if cooled over tens of thousands of years, might feature centimeter-sized crystals, Lee says.

            “Pegmatites cool relatively quickly, sometimes in just a few years, and yet they feature some of the largest crystals on Earth,” he says. “The big question is really, ‘How can that be?'”
            How fast do crystals grow?

            When Phelps began the research, his most immediate questions were about how to formulate a set of measurements that would allow him, Lee, and coauthor Douglas Morton of the University of California, Riverside to answer the big question.

            “It was more a question of, ‘Can we figure out how fast they actually grow?'” Phelps says. “Can we use trace elements—elements that don’t belong in quartz crystals—to figure out the growth rate?”

            It took more than three years, a field trip to gather sample crystals from a pegmatite mine in Southern California, hundreds of lab measurements to precisely map the chemical composition of the samples, and a deep dive into some 50-year-old materials science papers to create a mathematical model that could transform the chemical profiles into crystal growth rates.

            “We examined crystals that were half an inch wide and over an inch long,” Phelps says. “We showed those grew in a matter of hours, and there is nothing to suggest the physics would be different in larger crystals that measure a meter or more in length. Based on what we found, larger crystals like that could grow in a matter of days.”

            Pegmatites form where pieces of Earth’s crust are drawn down and recycled in the planet’s molten mantle. Any water that’s trapped in the crust becomes part of the melt, and as the melt rises and cools, it gives rise to many kinds of minerals. Each forms and precipitates out of the melt at a characteristic temperature and pressure. But the water remains, making up a progressively higher percentage of the cooling melt.

            “Eventually, you get so much water left over that it becomes more of a water-dominated fluid than a melt-dominated fluid,” Phelps says. “The leftover elements in this watery mixture can now move around a lot faster. Chemical diffusion rates are much faster in fluids and the fluids tend to flow more quickly. So when a crystal starts forming, elements can get to it faster, which means it can grow faster.”
            Surprising, but feasible

            Crystals are ordered arrangement of atoms. They form when atoms naturally fall into that arranged pattern based on their chemical properties and energy levels. For example, in the mine where Phelps collected his quartz samples, many crystals had formed in what appeared to be cracks that had opened while the pegmatite was still forming.

            “You see these pop up and go through the layers of pegmatite itself, almost like veins within veins,” Phelps says. “When those cracks opened, that lowered the pressure quickly. So the fluid rushed in, because everything’s expanding, and the pressure dropped dramatically. All of a sudden, all the elements in the melt are now confused. They don’t want to be in that physical state anymore, and they rapidly start coming together in crystals.”

            To decipher how quickly the sample crystals grew, Phelps used both cathodoluminescence microscopy and laser ablation with mass spectrometry to measure the precise amount of trace elements that had been incorporated into the crystal matrix at dozens of points during growth. From experimental work done by materials scientists in the mid-20th century, Phelps was able to decipher the growth rates from these profiles.

            “There are three variables,” he says. “There’s the likelihood of things getting brought in. That’s the partition coefficient. There’s how fast the crystal is growing, the growth rate. And then there’s the diffusivity, so how quickly elemental nutrients are brought to the crystal.”

            Phelps says the fast growth rates were quite a surprise.

            “Pegmatites are pretty short-lived, so we knew they had to grow relatively fast,” he says. “But we were showing it was a few orders of magnitude faster than anyone had predicted.

            “When I finally got one of these numbers, I remember going into Cin-Ty’s office, and saying, ‘Is this feasible? I don’t think this is right,'” Phelps recalls. “Because in my head, I was still kind of thinking about a thousand-year time scale. And these numbers were meaning days or hours.

            “And Cin-Ty says, ‘Well, why not? Why can’t it be right?'” Phelps says. “Because we’d done the math and the physics. That part was sound. While we didn’t expect it to be that fast, we couldn’t come up with a reason why it wasn’t plausible.”

        title: "Computer models solve magma ‘sweet spot’ mystery",
        body: `Computer models have revealed why the magma chambers that feed recurrent and often explosive volcanic eruptions tend to reside in a very narrow depth range within the Earth’s crust, researchers report.

The findings could help scientists to better understand volcanic processes the world over.

The research makes use of computer models that capture the physics of how magma chambers, reservoirs in the crust that contain partially molten rock, evolve over time.The models showed that two factors—the ability of water vapor to bubble out of the magma, and the ability of the crust to expand to accommodate chamber growth—are the key factors constraining the depth of magma chambers, which are generally found between six and 10 kilometers(between 3.7 and 6.2 miles) deep.

“…there seems to be a sweet spot in terms of depth for magma chambers that erupt repeatedly… Why that sweet spot exists has been an open question for a long time.”

“We know from observations that there seems to be a sweet spot in terms of depth for magma chambers that erupt repeatedly, ” says lead author Christian Huber, a geologist at Brown University.“Why that sweet spot exists has been an open question for a long time, and this is the first study that explains the processes that control it.”

Depths of six to 10 kilometers generally correspond to pressures of about 1.5 kilobars on the shallow side and 2.5 kilobars on the deep side.The models showed that at pressures less than 1.5 kilobars, water trapped within the magma forms bubbles readily, leading to violent volcanic explosions that blast more magma out of a chamber than can be replaced.These chambers quickly cease to exist.

At pressures more than 2.5 kilobars, warm temperatures deep inside the Earth make the rocks surrounding the magma chamber soft and pliable, which enables the chamber to grow comfortably without erupting to the surface.These systems cool and solidify over time without ever erupting.

“Between 1.5 and 2.5, the systems are happy, ” Huber says.“They can erupt, recharge, and keep going.”

The key to the models, Huber says, is that they capture the dynamics of both the host crust and of the magma in the chamber itself.The ability of deep magma chamber to grow without erupting was fairly well understood, but the limit that water vapor exerts on shallow magma chambers hadn’t been appreciated.

“There hadn’t been a good explanation for why this habitable zone should end at 1.5 kilobars, ” Huber says.“We show that the behavior of the gas is really important.It simply causes more mass to erupt out than can be recharged.”

Huber says the findings will be helpful in understanding the global magma budget.

“The ratio of magma that stays in the crust versus how much is erupted to the surface is a huge question, ” Huber says.“Magma supplies CO2 and other gases to the atmosphere, which influences the climate.So having a guide to understand what comes out and what stays in is important.”

The research appears in Nature Geoscience.
